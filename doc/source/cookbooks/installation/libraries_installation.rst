Libraries Installation
======================

To install the libraries necessary to run `Webnucleo <https://webnucleo.readthedocs.io>`_ codes, follow the instructions appropriate for your system.  Be sure
to note that a **$** in an example
code block in the instructions simply indicates
the command prompt--you do not type it.
